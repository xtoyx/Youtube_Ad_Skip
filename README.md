Hello , so this an addon for youtube bot that skip ads when it see on 
its working u need to install the requiments.txt 
pip install -r requiments.txt
<h2>Solved</h2>
<h3>Now it does work in one screen because it switch tabs :)</h3>
<h4>Problems :</h4>
<h6>Ingame cant switch ideas:</h6>
<h7>
-- make a kerneal that get commands from python like click this button etc...
-- use raspberyy pi 400 connect to pc and simulate the buttons </h7>
<h6>Auto Click:<h6>
<h7>
Still the auto click poisiton is off  ideas to fix it is :- make the user just point at the cursor we want and set it at that location if it off and save it like for different window size like for the two sizes one full and one in the side </h7>
